# CLAUDE.md

This file gives coding-agent guidance for this repository.

## What This Is

This checkout is a local Modeling Factory: a Python orchestrator with a frozen
Bash compatibility adapter that takes a math-modeling competition problem
through 10 persistent scheduler Stages while retaining 17 Step contracts
(Step 0–16), producing a finished paper PDF and supporting artifacts.

The active domain is CUMCM / MCM / ICM style applied mathematical modeling, not
the original economics/sociology Paper Factory. Legacy social-science prompts
and Stata helpers remain as historical reference, but their execution path is retired. New modeling work
must follow `STEPS.md` and `modeling_guide.md`.

There are three relevant audiences for code in this repo:

1. The control plane: `factory_core/`, `launch_agents.sh`, the `run_paper.sh` compatibility launcher, CLI, and Web.
2. The prompts each agent reads: `prompts/step*.txt`, `STEPS.md`, `modeling_guide.md`, `method_library/`.
3. The launched agents, which write markdown, Python/solver code, LaTeX, figures, tables, and result files inside project directories under `ongoing/`.

`README.md` is the user-facing intro. `STEPS.md` is the canonical step contract.
`modeling_guide.md` is the project-local style and execution contract. If
`analysis_guide.md` is also present, it is legacy context and does not override
`modeling_guide.md`.

## Common Commands

User-facing CLI from repo root:

```bash
./launch_agents.sh new [--no-start] [--consult] <base> "/abs/path/to/problem.pdf"
./launch_agents.sh resume <base> [<base2> ...]
./launch_agents.sh <base1> [<base2> ...]
./launch_agents.sh run <base>
./launch_agents.sh pause <base>
./launch_agents.sh consult <base>
./launch_agents.sh status
./launch_agents.sh attach <base>
./launch_agents.sh trace <base> [--lines N] [--follow]
```

Direct runner invocations:

```bash
./run_paper.sh <project_dir>
./run_paper.sh --infer-step <project_dir>
./run_paper.sh --status <project_dir>
python3 -m factory_core.cli audit <project_dir>
```

Inside a project directory:

```bash
../../solver_submit.sh --type python --max-time 600 \
  --input data/final/instance.json \
  --output results/problem1/values.json \
  --seed 20260804 \
  models/m3_milp/03_solve.py
../../solver_submit.sh --status <jobid>
../../solver_submit.sh --status <jobid> --json
../../solver_submit.sh --wait <jobid>
../../compile_paper.sh "$(pwd)" <base_name>
python3 ../../scripts/verify_numbers.py "$(pwd)" <base_name>
```

`solver_submit.sh` supports `python`, `julia`, `matlab`, `R`, and `gurobi` when
the corresponding executable is installed. Use explicit `--max-time` and
repeated `--input` / `--output` / `--seed` declarations for all nontrivial jobs.
Only `--status <jobid> --json` with `solver-job-evidence-v2` and
`receipt_ready=true` proves the submitted code/input identity and current
declared-output hashes; it does not prove optimality.

## Architecture

### Engine And Compatibility Launcher

`launch_agents.sh` and `run_paper.sh` forward to FactoryService and FactoryEngine.
The only active workflow is `engine` / `native_v2` / `stage_v1`, backed by
`.factory/state.db`. Ten persistent Stages schedule the existing Step 0–16
validation contracts. Existing `step_v2` Native projects require explicit
`factory migrate scheduler-activate`; Legacy migration and rollback are retired.

`factory_core/` owns revisioned transitions, events, retry budgets, recovery,
pending actions, native Stage/Step registration, audit, delivery and solver jobs.
The full pre-split source and experimental development contracts live separately
in `~/paper_new`. Do not copy experimental tables into a Native database.

New projects persist a 74-hourNew projects persist a 74-hour contest policy in schema-v9 SQLite. Steps 0–15
are capped at T−6h content freeze; Step 16 owns the six-hour terminal reserve
and is capped at the final deadline. T−2h is delivery freeze: any audit-driven
substantive reopen requires a separate human override. Retry sleeps are also
budget checked. Historical/migrated projects without a contest-policy row stay
unbounded for compatibility; do not synthesize an expired deadline for them.

Schema v9 represents every Human Gate occurrence as an immutable request
(`request_id`, gate, generation, subject/options fingerprints) and one optional
append-only decision instance. A rejected Approval remains historical evidence,
but content-freeze rejection clears the pending action, invalidates downstream
checkpoints, records `WORK_REOPENED`, and returns to Stage 9. The next
generation is created only when repaired work reaches the Gate again. Never
infer approval from the existence of a decision row or a selected option
string. Current Approval decisions also require a verified immutable receipt;
missing, symlinked, hash-mismatched, or identity-mismatched evidence fails
closed.

Experimental Authority/Phase sources and historical runners are preserved in
`~/paper_new`; see `docs/architecture/NATIVE_MAINLINE.md`. They are not imported
by this mainline, and their databases are rejected without automatic downgrade.

### State And Artifact Authority

For new and migrated projects, `.factory/state.db` is the workflow-state source
of truth. A transaction appends an event and updates the snapshot with a
monotonic `revision`. `checkpoint.md`, heartbeat, marker, PID, and diagnostics
files are compatibility projections and must not be used to overwrite SQLite.

`TransitionCoordinator` is the target application-writer boundary, not an
achieved unique-writer guarantee. At the current baseline, compatibility
decision recording, request supersede, prompt-attempt input binding, projection
failure bookkeeping, bootstrap/migration, and archive relocation still include
direct `SQLiteStateStore` writes. Do not add another bypass or claim exclusivity;
use the characterized inventory and future gate specification in
`docs/architecture/application_writer_allowlist_v1.json`.

Artifacts defined by `STEPS.md` remain validation evidence. Recovery calls the
registered Step validator: valid artifacts promote the interrupted Step;
invalid artifacts retry it. File modification times do not determine the
authoritative state.

Artifact authority is three-layered. Authored problem/model contracts,
structured decisions, canonical results, `paper.tex`, and the issue ledger are
business truth. Solver/audit receipts, hashes, fingerprints, and final
acceptance are immutable machine evidence. Checkpoint, method summaries, solve
logs, verification summaries, and Web status are rebuildable projections.
Step-3 and content-freeze decisions are read from SQLite first; their JSON and
Markdown forms are projections. For current Native projects,
`chosen_method.md` is generated from the immutable SQLite Step-3 decision and
`method_decision.md` carries the same machine-verifiable identity header. Step 3
validation and Step 4 prepare both verify the receipt, current candidate
fingerprints, and every projection identity field; `human_review.md` cannot
override them. Consultation decisions likewise store the exact answer in
SQLite, deterministically rebuild their `human_review.md` section, inject the
verified answer into the effective model prompt, and bind that prompt plus Web
researcher notes by SHA-256 in the Step result/checkpoint evidence.

Artifact responsibility is centralized in
`factory_core/artifact_ownership.py`. Dirty classification, semantic reopen,
Finalization recovery, Judge missing-evidence routing, Web diagnostics, and
final/submission manifests must consume that registry rather than add local
path-owner conditionals. Scheduler/control-mode rollback shares one guard that
rejects active attempts, unresolved dirty/projection state, pending Finalization
snapshots, unfinished human decisions, and any current manifest drift from
`stage_cursor_input`. Dirty state is keyed by `(flag, owner_stage)` so one
domain cannot overwrite another Stage's active cause. Final/submission
collection fails closed when a tracked authored file has neither registry
ownership nor an explicit active-LaTeX or declared-deliverable route.

Native failure events preserve execution and validation metadata such as the
failed check, role, backend, report, and missing artifact paths. A model process
that exits zero without producing the required artifact is
`TRANSIENT_ARTIFACT_MISSING`, not an unclassified success. Permanently rejected
model routes are quarantined in the worker and a healthy configured fallback is
tried; a missing API credential or unsupported model must not be invoked again
on every workflow retry.

`run_paper.sh --infer-step` reads Native SQLite state only. Projects without
Native state remain historical artifacts and cannot execute here.

### Audit And Delivery Boundary

Step 4, Step 5/6, and Step 10 run cacheable `model`, `results`, and `paper`
profiles. Their records live under
`.factory/audits/profiles/<profile>/<snapshot>/`, synchronize deterministic
failures into `audit_issue_ledger.md`, and always set `delivery_allowed=false`.
Step 15 is the `CONTENT_READY` boundary. The `final` profile owns release
acceptance checks, compilation, visual inspection, isolated judge execution,
decision routing, snapshot fingerprints, and judgment receipts. Final records
are stored under `.factory/audits/<snapshot>/`; current `judge_outputs/` files
remain compatibility projections.

`python3 -m factory_core.cli audit <project>` runs that subsystem independently
in analysis-only mode. It may write audit/Judge evidence, but must not create
`final_submission.sha256`, an override receipt, or a final acceptance receipt,
publish into `papers/`, package, clean, archive, or mutate SQLite workflow state.
Contest-policy and approval-fingerprint reads use a private main/WAL snapshot,
without upgrading the source schema, changing journal mode, or writing source
WAL/SHM files. Unsupported or incomplete approval state blocks analysis.
Analysis results use `.factory/audits/analysis_latest.json`; rerunning analysis
for an accepted snapshot does not replace its acceptance-authority `latest.json`.
Step 16 is a compatibility adapter: Native explicitly selects acceptance mode;
The CLI supports `audit --accept-delivery` for explicit acceptance. Only after that boundary may a
Native `PASS` or explicit `OVERRIDDEN` result be published and packaged.
Experimental databases are rejected by the Native boundary.
Final analysis ordering is compile → full paper/provenance checks → visual/page
gate → packets/fingerprint → enforce-mode three-role Judge → snapshot recheck →
judgment receipt; acceptance adds the final-submission marker and final acceptance receipt.
Audit failures return
structured repair hints to the engine; the audit subsystem does not directly
rewind workflow state.

Delivery override authority lives only in `web/auth.db`. The scopes are
`continue_after_gate2` and `deliver_snapshot`; the latter must bind the exact
64-character final snapshot and is consumed when the final acceptance is
recorded. A project-local `gate2_delivery_override.json` never authorizes
anything. This is an operational boundary for the single-operator deployment,
not cryptographic isolation from another process running as the same Unix UID.
The same control database owns identity and `project_acl`, but none of those
records replaces project-local workflow decisions in `.factory/state.db` or
advances its scheduler. Conversely, a project decision never grants Web access
or an override. The two databases have different trust scopes and lifecycles.

Step 16 publishes immutable releases under
`papers/releases/<base>/<snapshot>/` and atomically replaces only
`papers/<base>/current.json` after all bytes and receipts verify. Flat
`papers/<base>_paper.pdf` and `_submission.zip` files are compatibility aliases,
not release authority. Native adapters use the same
Final Audit and release publisher.

### Human Consultation Window (opt-in)

Lets a human inject GPT Pro / Gemini Deep Think conclusions into the otherwise
autonomous pipeline. **Off by default** — enable per project with
`new --consult` (writes `consultation/enabled`) or env `CONSULT_ENABLE=1`. When
off, prompts and behavior are byte-identical, so unattended benchmark/ablation
runs are unaffected.

Native consultation gates persist immutable decision requests in SQLite and
project request/answer views into `consultation/` and `human_review.md`.
Use `launch_agents.sh consult NAME` to inspect a pending request, then the Web
or CLI decision path to resolve it. Verified decisions are embedded in prompts;
projection files alone cannot authorize workflow advancement.

### Prompt Rendering

Prompts live in `prompts/step*.txt`. `render_prompt` prepends a common preamble:
read the project style guide, prefer `modeling_guide.md`, read
`human_review.md` if present, and do not reuse completed projects. It
substitutes:

- `__PROJECT_PATH__`
- `__RESEARCH_QUESTION__`
- `__BASE_NAME__`
- `__FACTORY__`
- Step-specific placeholders such as `__STREAM_ID__`

Optional researcher notes can be supplied through `web/notes.json` keyed by
base name and step.

### Agent Dispatch

Step functions call primitives such as:

- `run_codex`
- `run_claude_worker`
- `run_claude_then_codex`
- `run_codex_then_claude`
- `run_codex_parallel`
- `run_agy`

Hang detection watches trace-file freshness, but solver children count as real
work. The process whitelist includes Python, Julia, MATLAB, R, Gurobi, CPLEX,
SCIP, IPOPT, Octave, and legacy Stata names.

## Active Modeling Workflow

See `STEPS.md` for exact outputs and line/file gates. In short:

- Setup / Step 0: parse a competition problem into `problem/`, generate the
  validated `problem-plan-v1` dependency DAG, and run hierarchical method
  retrieval across the curated and authorized HMML registries.
- Step 1: background research, candidate methods, viability gate.
- Step 2: parallel modeling proposals, demo solves, critic verdicts.
- Step 3: Human Gate 1 selects PRIMARY/AUXILIARY from validated demo solves; SQLite is authoritative and `human_review.md` is a projection.
- Step 4: full model construction, symbol table, assumption ledger, runnable code, then the `model` audit profile.
- Step 5: full solve through `solver_submit.sh`, then the Step-5 `results` audit checkpoint.
- Step 6: sensitivity and robustness, then the Step-6 `results` audit checkpoint.
- Step 7: model evaluation.
- Step 8: visualization polish.
- Step 9: full paper draft with `ABSTRACT_PLACEHOLDER`.
- Step 10: `paper` profile for numerical, code, result, and deliverable consistency; symbol findings are warnings.
- Step 11: constructive review.
- Step 12: revision and archive of the pre-revision draft.
- Step 13: isolated math-only precheck; `PRECHECK_PASS` allows progress but never delivery.
- Step 14: abstract replacement.
- Step 15: citation audit, table/prose polish, de-robotification; these edits make the Step-13 precheck non-final and produce the `CONTENT_READY` boundary.
- Step 16: require Human Gate 2 (`content_freeze`) before execution, then explicitly request acceptance for the independent final-audit result . On a cache miss the audit subsystem compiles a fresh PDF, reruns Gate 2 on the post-Step-15 packets, and binds the decision to the evaluator and exact PDF bytes. Only a Native accepted result may then be copied, packaged, cleaned, and moved to `complete/`; default audit alone performs none of those delivery mutations or acceptance writes.

Step 13 precheck verdict tokens are `PRECHECK_PASS`,
`REOPEN_REVISION_MODEL`, and `INDETERMINATE_REVIEW`. Final-audit Gate 2 verdict
tokens are:

- `VERDICT: PASS`
- `VERDICT: REOPEN_REVISION_TEXT`
- `VERDICT: REOPEN_REVISION_MODEL`

Math and execution use the hard three-valued state `PASS / FAIL / INDETERMINATE`. Paper six-dimension scores are conditional: they are comparable only when both hard roles PASS and every role output satisfies `judge-role-v1`. A hard FAIL, missing evidence, malformed output, or INDETERMINATE state must not be averaged into a score.

Only a substantive math/execution `FAIL` consumes the scientific reopen budget.
Malformed output, quote grounding failure, unavailable judge routing, and an
otherwise indeterminate review retry only the affected audit role and stop as
`PERMANENT_JUDGE_INFRASTRUCTURE` when exhausted. A packet that
names a genuinely absent upstream artifact reopens that artifact's earliest
owning Step; packet truncation or judge uncertainty does not default to Step 4.
All role packets must be eligible before the first model call, including direct
prepared/precheck entry points. If an artifact's registered recovery boundary
is not earlier than the active Step, report `PERMANENT_RECOVERY_TARGET` with the
missing paths instead of emitting an invalid scheduler transition.

The runner allows one repair cycle. If the reopened or final-submission judge still does not PASS, normal delivery is blocked. Legacy Markdown scorecards are `LEGACY_UNVERIFIED` and are never comparison-ready under the current contract.

## Cross-Step State

Important project files include:

- `checkpoint.md`: status display only; not authoritative.
- `problem/*.md`: parsed problem, constraints, data inventory, candidate methods.
- `problem/problem_plan.json`: authored problem-specific scientific DAG;
  deterministic validation and audit fingerprints bind it, while SQLite
  Stage/Step state remains the workflow authority.
- `viable_streams.md`, `m<N>_spec.md`, `m<N>_critique.md`: Step 2 stream state.
- `method_decision.md`, `chosen_method.md`: selected primary/auxiliary method.
- `model.md`, `symbol_table.md`, `assumption_ledger.md`: modeling state.
- `solve_log.md`, `results/**`: numerical evidence.
- `sensitivity_report.md`, `evaluation.md`, `visualization_log.md`: downstream evidence.
- `audit_issue_ledger.md`: issue status tracker. `AUDIT-*` rows are maintained by stage profiles; blocking issues must not be silently dropped.
- `.factory/audits/profiles/**`: non-delivery `model` / `results` / `paper` snapshots and attempts.
- `.factory/audits/latest.json`: current `profile=final` audit record used by delivery.
- `judge_outputs/final_paper_checks.json`: hash-bound final paper/provenance check report.
- `judge_outputs/final_acceptance_receipt.json`: binds the approved snapshot to PDF, checks, visual gate, decision route, judgment or override receipt, and the exact `submission-bundle-manifest-v2` identity.
- `logs/compilation/latex_inputs.json`: compiler-recorder proof that project-local TeX inputs equal the declared `LatexCompileContract` dependency graph.
- `.factory/finalization/submission_bundle_manifest.json`: exact, path-safe ZIP member list with size and SHA-256; unreferenced `paper/` drafts are excluded.
- `judge_evaluation.md`: Step-13 `PRECHECK_PASS` control file until the final audit replaces it with the full aggregate verdict.
- `judge_packets/**`, `judge_outputs/**`: isolated evidence manifests, strict role outputs, aggregate JSON, and final-submission fingerprint. Each manifest carries `judge-packet-completeness-v1`; required evidence that is missing, truncated, or omitted forces the role to `INDETERMINATE`, while non-critical truncation must remain visible in `limitations`.

Protected assumptions or issues must not be deleted or downgraded without a
clear evidence-backed reason.

## Solver Execution Model

Use `solver_submit.sh`, not ad hoc background jobs, for nontrivial runs:

```bash
../../solver_submit.sh --type python --max-time 1800 \
  --input results/canonical_results.json \
  --output results/sensitivity/summary.json \
  --seed 20260804 \
  models/m3_milp/05_sensitivity.py
```

The wrapper exposes `FACTORY_SOLVER_JOB_ID` to the solver. Query public evidence
through `--status <jobid> --json`; do not inspect SQLite or mutable Legacy
metadata as proof. Submission receipts bind runtime/code/inputs/argv digest/
seeds, completion receipts bind terminal status and declared output hashes;
native jobs also bind both receipt hashes into workflow events.
Stdout remains next to the script as `<script>.log`, and stderr under `logs/`.

Historical Stata and Legacy entry points are preserved in `~/paper_new`.

## Figures, Tables, And LaTeX

Follow `modeling_guide.md`:

- Figures: academic palette, self-contained captions, PDF plus PNG when useful.
- Tables: `booktabs`, right-aligned numeric columns, compact labels.
- Symbols: every variable and parameter used in the model must appear in `symbol_table.md` and the paper's symbol table.
- LaTeX: CUMCM/MCM-style sections, with abstract filled only at Step 14.
- Compilation: use `compile_paper.sh`; it selects `xelatex` for `ctex`, `cumcmthesis`, `mcmthesis`, or `xeCJK`, sanitizes TeX search paths, runs without shell escape, verifies all three recorder files, and emits `bibliography-build-receipt-v1`. BibTeX/Biber failures, stale `.bbl` reuse, unresolved citations, project symlinks, and non-runtime external reads are fatal.

## Web Control Plane Contract

The stable ASGI entry is `apps.web.backend.main:app`. During the repository
boundary transition, `web/backend/main.py` contains the FastAPI implementation;
`web/backend/app.py` is only a compatibility launcher/re-export.

Authentication and approvals are persisted in SQLite at `web/auth.db` through
`web/backend/auth_store.py`. Passwords are bcrypt hashes. Registration creates
a pending user; administrators approve users and project requests. A non-admin
user sees and manages only projects granted through `project_acl`, while an
administrator can manage all projects. Read-only paper visibility is a separate
`showcase_acl`: visitors use the `guest` audience, and active users inherit that
public set plus their personal grants. `SHOWCASE_PROJECTS` seeds the guest
audience only when an existing database is first upgraded to this contract.

Engine project creation, lifecycle controls, and solver policy call
`FactoryService` directly. FastAPI owns authentication, ACL checks, and HTTP
error mapping; it does not route these commands through shell subprocesses.

The Web project list exposes `problem_key`, `problem_title`, `storage_scope`,
`archived`, and the workflow `revision`. Equivalent contained problem statements share a canonical
SHA-256 identity so the frontend can group multiple runs into one problem
archive. This grouping does not move or rename project directories:
`ongoing/` and `complete/` remain authoritative storage.

The authenticated project workspace uses `contest-dashboard-v1` from
`GET /api/projects/{base}/contest-dashboard` for the eight-phase view, timing
forecast, persistent action center, evidence cockpit, and delivery-readiness
checks. It must show Legacy projects as unconfigured instead of inventing a
contest clock. Human Gate submissions remain revision-checked and SQLite
append-only. `GET /api/projects/{base}/submission` resolves and verifies the
atomic current release before serving a ZIP; it must never trust a flat alias
or an arbitrary project path. Both endpoints enforce the same `project_acl` as
other internal project details.

`GET /api/projects/{base}/modeling-directions` and
`GET /api/projects/{base}/problem-plan` expose `node-output-v1` typed
`ContentBlock` payloads. The frontend registry renders method cards, notices,
key/value summaries, artifact links, and DAGs without accepting backend HTML.

Production secrets are loaded from GCP Secret Manager by
`scripts/load_secrets.sh`. `JWT_SECRET` (at least 32 characters) and a strong
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are mandatory; startup rejects missing or weak values. Never
document a default password, automatic JWT generation, secret value, or secret
prefix. `web/README.md` owns current usage and
`web/docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md` owns current production operations.

## Editing Notes

- Runtime directories (`ongoing/`, `complete/`, `papers/`, `logs/`, `run_state/`) and project `.factory/` databases are gitignored.
- Do not commit `.env`, credentials, generated logs, PDFs, or benchmark downloads.
- Inspect every worktree before cleanup. Do not remove a worktree, branch,
  backup, gitlink, log, or local credential file until its exact contents and
  recovery value have been reported and the user has explicitly approved the
  destructive action.
- `run_paper.sh` must remain a thin compatibility launcher. Existing Step shell changes belong in the frozen adapter; new scheduling behavior belongs in `factory_core/`.
- Root `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, hash-locked Web/Cloud exports, and frontend `package-lock.json` own dependency resolution. Runtime start scripts must not install packages.
- Do not change `STEPS.md`, `modeling_guide.md`, or active prompts casually; they are agent contracts.
- Keep historical prompt/data files unless deletion is explicitly approved. They are not an executable compatibility promise.
